/**
 * Provides a Kinesis Video Stream resource. Amazon Kinesis Video Streams makes it easy to securely stream video from connected devices to AWS for analytics, machine learning (ML), playback, and other processing.
 *
 * For more details, see the [Amazon Kinesis Documentation][1].
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const defaultVideoStream = new aws.kinesis.VideoStream("default", {
 *     dataRetentionInHours: 1,
 *     deviceName: "kinesis-video-device-name",
 *     mediaType: "video/h264",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "kinesis-video-stream",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
